      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new blog. This will be the place I share the coding experiences have and learn while working on my various projects. With that said, who am I and what am I working on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a 21 year old, fourth year student studying at The University of Texas at Austin. I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I thoroughly enjoy programming, both the thrill of gettting something to work and the science/math of algorithms and data structures. The majority of my programming projects have revolved around games. The first major project I did was creating an application that tracked guild currency for my guild. My latest project is a suite of tools to let users install, modify, and create game asset modifications of the game League of Legends. It required reverse engineering quite a few file formats and learning how to hook the game process in order to allow run-time asset swapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two big projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now are The Dargon Project and Z-engine for ScummVM. The Dargon Project is the aforementioned suite of applications. Z-engine is my project for Google Summer of Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z-engine:
The Z-Engine is used in the games Zork Nemesis and Zork Grand Inquisitor. Marisa Chan created a C implementation of the engine, but it is only for desktop and requires configuration files. The project aims to create a ScummVM engine using Marisa Chan’s implementation code as a guide into the Zork file structure and engine design. That is, it will not simply adapt the current implementation to the ScummVM engine structure. Rather, it will create a new engine, using the file structures and event implementations in Marisa Chan’s code as a reference. ScummVM will allow these games to be played on a variety of platforms and a redesign will remove the need for configuration files. Lastly, it will mean that ScummVM will support all of the Zork point&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;click adventure games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely thrilled be one of the lucky people to be a part of Google Summer of Code. ScummVM is an amazing group of developers and I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to being a part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. My next post will most likely be about that start of GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;
